# Variable names

The names of the variables must necessarily be in English and must be pronounceable, we show below a **bad** example:

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js">

```typescript
// bad, these names we must avoid
const n = 53;

const tx = 0.15;

const coms = 1;

const mmddyyyy = new Date('April 24, 2000 00:00:00');
```

</div>

You have to try not to save characters when naming these variables. What we are looking for is that each of these names are very expressive.

```typescript
// better
const numberOfUnits = 53;

const tax = 0.15;

const comissions = 1:

const birthDate = new Date('April 24, 2000 00:00:00');
```

## Lack of technical information

```typescript
// bad
class AbstractUser { };
class UserMixin { };
class UserImplementation { };
interface UserInterface { };
```

```typescript
// better
class User { };
interface User { };
```

# Names according to data type

## Arrays 

For arrays, we know that they are an iterable list or the elements have something in common.

```typescript 
// bad 
const fruit = ['apple', 'orange', 'strewberry']
```
```typescript 
// regular
const fruitList = ['apple', 'orange', 'strewberry']
```
```typescript 
// good 
const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'strewberry']
```
```typescript 
// better 
const fruitNames = ['apple', 'orange', 'strewberry']
```

## Booleans

They usually have two values ​​(with the exception of undefined, null) this is not always the case and depends on the language

For this case, the use of prefixes (is, has, can) is recommended.

```typescript 
// bad
const open = true;
const write = true;
const active = true;
const fruit = false;
const notEmpty = false;
const noValues = false;
```

```typescript 
// better
const isOpen = true;
const canWrite = true;
const isActive = true;
const hasFruit = false;
const isEmpty = false;
const hasValues = false;
```

## Numbers

You can use many words, use prefixes like min, max, or use the word "of"

```typescript
// bad
const fruits = 3;
const cars = 10; 
```
```typescript
// better
const maxFruits = 5;
const minFruits = 1;
const totalFruits = 1;

const totalOfCars = 10; 
```

## Functions 

They have several characteristics. They must represent actions, which generally must be named with the verb that represents the action followed by a noun. They should be descriptive and concise. You must express what you do and refrain from all implementation.

```typescript
// bad
createUserIfNotExists();
updateUserIfNotEmpty();
sendEmailIfFieldsValid();
```
```typescript
// better
createUser();
updateUser();
sendEmail();
```

## Classes

Classes should have names of nouns or noun phrases, avoid generic names because they can lead to classes doing more work than they should.

* The name is the most important thing in the class
* They shouldn't be too generic.
* Use UpperCamelCase

```typescript
// bad
class Manager {};
class User {};
class Data {};
class Info {};
```

3 Questions to determine/know if it is a good class name:

* What exactly does the class do?
* How exactly does this class perform a certain task? 
* Is there anything specific about his location?

If something doesn't make sense, it should be removed or refactored.

Advice: `more words !== better name`
```typescript
// bad
class SpecialViewingCaseMonsterManagerEvents {};
```

# Functions

> _"We know we're developing clean code when each function does exactly what its name says."_ -**Ward Cunningham**

```typescript
function sendEmail (toWhom: string): boolean {

  // Verify email address
  if (!toWhom.includes("@")) return false;

  // Build body or message

  // Send email

  // If everything goes well
  return true;
}
```
Look at the example above. (Let's avoid internally how the function is built) the function obviously indicates that I want to send an email to that recipient, and return a boolean value.

We can see here the definition of it in which we have to verify an email, it is a small piece of fairly basic code. Otherwise, it does not come at at, we return **_false_**. and if not, then the body, the message or other things are built, but this remains subjective.

So this function, what it's literally doing is that.

Check the mail, build the body of the message that we want to send.

Send the mail and if everything goes well, return a **_true_**.

But let's look at this other exercise in which we have email this way sendemail doesn't receive any arguments and returns a boolean value.

Ok, so I would think it does not mean that the function is wrong.

That is not so, it is not the problem.

Because it could be that you have the email in another place, or that it is in a slightly higher scope in which it can be taken from there or perhaps some environment variable.

```typescript
function sendEmail (): boolean {

  // Verify user exists

  // Verify password

  // Create a new email at db

  // If everything goes well
  return true;
}
```

In here we are seeing that it says to verify if the user exists. This doesn't make much sense in this function. I would not expect to see this here.

The next action is Check password. The password for what? It may be that we are checking the password of the person's email, that is, of the email that we are going to use to send the mail. It could be that it is, but then comes creating a mailbox in the database and that doesn't make much sense.

**The function is called sin email.**

It's not sending any email, it's working like doing a login or something else.

So this is what we mean when we say **_Function names have to do exactly what their function name says._** That's all.

## Parameters and arguments

When we are defining a function, these variables are called **_parameters_**.

```typescript
function sendEmail (toWhom: string): boolean {
  // Verify email address
  if (!toWhom.includes("@")) return false;
  return true;
}
```

On the other hand, when we invoke this function, they are called **_arguments_**.

```typescript
sendEmail('castromaciel@email.com')
```

Now why do we highlight this?

Well, because **there is no limit to the number of parameters that we can define**.

The problem is that it is recommended that we limit it to three. The truth is that it is not a problem, but when there are more than three, the functions look quite heavy to read when they have many parameters.

As you can see here:

```typescript
// bad
function sendEmail(toWhom: string, from: string, body: string, subject: string, apiKey: string): boolean {

}
```
All of this line up here is exactly the same as what I have down here:
```typescript
// bad
function sendEmail(
  toWhom : string,
  from   : string,
  body   : string,
  subject: string, 
  apiKey : string
): boolean {

}
```
Only here it's ordered with a different tab stop, but it's basically the same. And these lines are literally the same, only there are better tabs.

Other problem is, when we are working with positional arguments, if we want to send only the **_apiKey_**, it must necessarily send the other parameters.

So, a better way to work this is to send 3 or 1 parameter. Why only one parameter? Because we can do this:

```typescript
// better
interface SendEmailOptions {
  apiKey : string
  body   : string,
  from   : string,
  subject: string, 
  toWhom : string,
}

function sendEmail({
  apiKey, body, from, subject, toWhom
}: SendEmailOptions): boolean {

} 
```

That helps a lot to make it easier to read, easier to maintain and that we have the relationship of each one of these.

There is also another recommendation, which is that their properties are ordered alphabetically.


Other recomendations

  - Simplicity is essential.
  - The functions must have a reduced size.
  - One-line functions without causing complexity.
  - Based on the Clean Code book, less than 20 lines.
  - Avoid using _else_.
  - Prioritize the use of the _ternary conditional_ (as far as possible)

**Bad example!!**
```ts
const getDeduction = ({
  isAffiliate = false, isPremium = true, hasChristmasDeduction = false, amountToPay = 100
}): number => {
  let result;
  if (isAffiliate) {
    result = amountToPay / 0.1;
  } else {
    if (isPremium) {
      result = amountToPay / 0.2;
    } else {
      if (hasChristmasDeduction) {
        result = amountToPay / 0.25;
      } else {
        result = amountToPay; 
      }
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

**Better**
```ts
const getDeduction = ({
  isAffiliate = false, isPremium = true, hasChristmasDeduction = false, amountToPay = 100
}): number => {
  if (isAffiliate) return amountToPay / 0.1;

  if (isPremium) return amountToPay / 0.2;

  return hasChristmasDeduction ? 0.25 : amountToPay
}
```
